String Theory, on the other hand, has been around for decades and has a large community of researchers working on it. It has also led to many important insights in mathematics and physics, like the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates gravity in higher dimensions to quantum field theories in lower dimensions. However, String Theory is incredibly complex, with many different versions and a vast landscape of possible solutions.
